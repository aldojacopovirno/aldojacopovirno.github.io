> Curious by nature, drawn to everything that bridges theory and reality. Iâ€™m interested in understanding and navigating complex systems through scientific rigor. I see research as a form of exploration and science as a shared language for making sense of uncertainty.

## What I do?

Currently, I am a **BSc student in Statistics and Computer Science for Business, Finance, and Insurance** at University of Naples "_Parthenope_", where my research spans quantitative finance, machine learning, and the physics of complex systems. 

I am particularly focused on developing algorithms that connect mathematical theory with real-world applications, from financial modeling to data-driven research across multiple domains.

## Before

- Former **Head of Research** at [Napoli Fintech Lab](https://disaq.uniparthenope.it/fintechlab/), where I guided projects at the intersection of finance, technology, and data science. My role focused on shaping research directions, coordinating interdisciplinary efforts, and translating advanced quantitative methods into practical tools for financial innovation.
- Ex **Founder & CTO** of [GreenWall Research](https://www.linkedin.com/company/greenwall-research), an independent initiative dedicated to algorithmic research and the application of machine learning to complex problems. At GreenWall, I led the development of research frameworks, explored novel modeling approaches, and oversaw projects designed to bridge theoretical insights with real-world applications across finance, insurance, and risk analysis.
